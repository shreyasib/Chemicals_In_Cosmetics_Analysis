# Chemicals in Cosmetics


Data Source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chemicals-in-cosmetics-7d6ab

## Introduction
These data reflect information that has been reported to the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) in the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The primary purpose of the CSCP is to collect information on hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California and to make this information available to the public.

For all cosmetic products sold in California, the California Safe Cosmetics Act (“the Act”) requires the manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label to provide to the CSCP a list of all cosmetic products that contain any ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or other developmental or reproductive harm.
