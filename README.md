#### Strategic Recommendations
To deliver the insights and provide recommendations based on the analysis:

1. Increase transparency about the chemicalss used in products. This could include providing clear and detailed ingredient lists, as well as information about the sources and safety of the ingredients used. Brands like Sephora(7 chemicals), Sally Hansen(7), Christian Dior(6) and Palladio(10) have a high chemical load. Products with higher than 5 chemicals can have a a label that idicates the same on it's products. This will allow the consumers to make an informed decision before buying the product.
2. Invest in research and development to find safer alternatives to potentially hazardous chemicals. This could include partnering with academic or research institutions, or investing in in-house R&D efforts.
3. Work with regulatory agencies and industry organizations to establish standards and guidelines for the use of chemicals in cosmetic products. This could help ensure that products are safe and effective, while also promoting transparency and accountability.
