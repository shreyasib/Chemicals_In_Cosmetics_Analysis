#### Strategic Recommendations
To deliver the insights and provide recommendations based on the analysis:

1. Brands like Sephora(7), Sally Hansen(7), Christian Dior(6) and Palladio(10) have a high chemical usage. Products with higher than 5 chemicals can have a a label that idicates the same on it's products. This will allow the consumers to make an informed decision before buying the product.
2. It is also alarming to observe that Skin care uses more chemicals than make-up products. Consumers have a general consensus about makeup being harmful but skincare does not maintain the same reputation. Through a more informative product labelling, consumers must be informed of the harmful effects of skincare products that use high quanity of chemicals.
